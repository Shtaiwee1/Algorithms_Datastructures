//In built in sorting in javascript

//Telling javascript how to sort
/*
The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort
The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
If it returns a positive number, a should come after b,
If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned

//example
/*
function numberCompare(num1, num2) {
  return num1 - num2;
}

[ 6, 4, 15, 10 ].sort(numberCompare);
// [ 4, 6, 10, 15 ]



function compareByLen(str1, str2) {
  return str1.length - str2.length;
}

[ "Steele", "Colt", "Data Structures", "Algorithms" ]
  .sort(compareByLen);
// [ "Colt", "Steele", "Algorithms", "Data Structures" ]
