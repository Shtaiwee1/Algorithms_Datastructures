//Insertion and removal big O notation depend on where you want to insert or remove the element
//So if you want to insert or remove at the end of an array it's O(1) but in the beginning of an array it's O(n) Because you have to reindex every single element in the array
//Searching O(n)
//Access O(1)

//push O(1)
//pop O(1)
//shift O(n)
//unshift O(n)
//concat O(n)
//sliceO(n)
//splice O(n)
//sortO(nlogn)
//map/filter/reduce/foreach...etc  O(n)
